<h1 class="body-header">But Wait, There's More!</h1>
<p class="body-text">
  The study of linear regression is a deep topic: there's a ton of different
  things to talk about and we'd be remiss to try to cover them all in a single
  article! In order to keep this article as short and digestible as possible, we
  had to leave a lot out. For a deeper dive into the topic, check out the
  resources listed below. In addition, here are some topics we wish we had more
  space to cover in this article:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Regularization</li>
  <li>P-Values</li>
  <li>Evaluation Metrics</li>
  <li>Causal Inference</li>
  <li>Bayesian formulations of regression</li>
  <li>Model Concerns</li>
</ul>
<p class="body-text">
  This is not an exhaustive list, but it's one we hope will get you started in
  learning about one of machine learning's most important algorithms!

  Thanks for reading. We hope that the article is insightful no matter where you
  are along your Machine Learning journey, and that you came away with a better
  understanding of some of the difficulties of evaluating classification models.
