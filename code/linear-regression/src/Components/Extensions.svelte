<h1 class="body-header">But Wait, There's More!</h1>
<p class="body-text">
  The study of linear regression is a deep topic: there's a ton of different
  things to talk about and we'd be foolish to try to cover them all in one
  single article. We hope this article serves as a nice take-off point for
  learning about regression.
  <br /><br />
  Here's a list of things that we wish we had more space to cover in this article.
  If you'd like to learn more, consider looking them up for yourself! It is not an
  exhaustive list, but it's one we hope will get you started in learning about one
  of machine learning's most important algorithms!:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Regularization</li>
  <li>Transformations</li>
  <li>Selection Methods</li>
  <li>Evaluation Metrics</li>
  <li>Causal Inference</li>
  <li>Bayesian formulations of regression</li>
  <li>Model Concerns</li>
</ul>

  For those interested in diving deeper into regression, consult the resources
  we list at the end of the article.
  <br /><br />
  Go forth and learn!

  Thanks for reading. We hope that the article is insightful no matter where you
  are along your Machine Learning journey, and that you came away with a better
  understanding of linear regression.
