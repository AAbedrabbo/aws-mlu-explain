    "In our previous discussion of the bias-variance tradeoff, we ended with a note about one of modern machine learning's more surprising phenomena: double descent. Double descent is interesting because it appears to stand counter to our classical understanding of the bias-variance tradeoff. Namely, while we expect the best model perfrrormance to be obtained via some balance between bias (underfitting) and variance (overfitting), we instead observe strong test performance from very overfit, complex models.\n",
