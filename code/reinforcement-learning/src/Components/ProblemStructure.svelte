  <p class="body-text">
    In reinforcement learning problems, there is an *agent* who makes decisions
    and learns how to achieve a goal. This agent interacts with the
    *environment* by taking *actions*. The environment produces *rewards* as a
    result of the actions taken, and these rewards provide insight into the
    overall *value* of taking an action in a particular state. Actions may
    affect the environment, leading to changes in *state*, which the agent
    observes. This process continues with the agent taking actions and observing
    the resulting reward. The agent uses this information to learn what actions
    it should take depending on the circumstance. This mapping from states to
    actions is called a *policy*. The agent also learns a *value function* which
    it uses to predict how desirable states are when behaving according to the
    policy. The learning in reinforcement learning comes from the agent changing
    its policy and updating its value function as a result of its experiences in
    the environment.
    <br /><br />
    Typically, the agent interacts with the environment over time. At each time point,
    an action is taken based on the agentâ€™s policy, a reward is obtained, and the
    next state is observed. The sequence of transitions experienced by the agent
    starting from the intitial state until the final state is called a trial or
    an episode.
