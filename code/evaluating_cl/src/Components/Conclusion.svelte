  When it comes to evaluating classifiers (or any class of model), the above metrics are by no means exhaustive - many other techniques exist!
  To make things compact and as focused on machine learning as possible, we skipped some related concepts like callibration, popular diagnostic tools 
  (specificity, likelihood ratios, etc.), and expectation frameworks. We do plan to cover the closley-related concepts of ROC and AUC in the nearby future,
  so look out for that!

  <!-- You probably also noticed that our examples 
  And, if we're being honest with outselves (I've been working on self-reflection), neither are the explanations.
  So far, all of our ex
  For one, our examples have been pretty simples: they only involve two categories (what we call binary classification), 
  While all of the techniques we discussed in the context ofbinary classification, (a conscous choice for exemplary reasons), they're very easily extendable to
  a multiclass setting.


  This was a conscious decision: our goal is to explain <i>intuitively</i> 
  Many similar metrics working in terms of False Positives. Many operate using our confusion terms (False Positives, etc.), 
  including Radio Operator Curves (ROC) and Area Under the Curve (AUC), which we'll cover in a future article (stay tuned!).
  Other techniques, such as callibration, exist in a probabilistic framework.
