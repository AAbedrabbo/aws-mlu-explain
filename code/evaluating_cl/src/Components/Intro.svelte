    Many machine learning tasks involve <span class="bold">classification</span>: 
    the act of predicting a discrete category for some given input. Examples of classifiers include 
    predicting whether a package will arrive early, late, or on time, or determining 
    whether the item in front of your phone's camera is a hot dog or not.

   Evaluating a classifier requires careful consideration. 
    In this article, we'll explore why accuracy isn't always
     a great measure of classification performance, and 
    discuss some common evaluation metrics we can use in its place. 
    We'll motivate our problem with an binary (i.e. two outcome) classification of
     classifying package delivery. To aid us in
    our evaluation, we'll make use of the <span class="bold">confusioen matrix</span>:
